# POPMENU TEST

This is a simple Rails API as part of popmenu test

## Tech and Versions
- Ruby 3.3.4
- Rails 7.2.1
- Sqlite 3
- Docker 27


## Testing
I decided to use rspec as test framework because I'm more familiar with it and I also think it's a bit easear to read the specs (probably because I have more experience with haha)

## Thinking out loud
Here I'll explain why I decided to do one thing or other when doing some progress on the test
